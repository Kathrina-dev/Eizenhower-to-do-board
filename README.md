# Eizenhower to-do board ðŸš€

This project was created to help manage tasks efficiently using the Eisenhower Matrix. The matrix prioritizes tasks based on urgency and importance, making it easy to decide which tasks to tackle first.

# Motivation ðŸŒŸ

As a long-time user of the Eisenhower Matrix, I found the traditional method of writing tasks down on paper cumbersome, especially when pen and paper arenâ€™t readily available. Hence, I built this responsive web application that incorporates the same functionality and works seamlessly across different screen sizesâ€”making it a pocket-friendly solution for organizing tasks on the go!

# Features
Task Categorization: Tasks are sorted into four quadrants based on urgency and importance:

Urgent & Important

Not Urgent but Important

Urgent but Not Important

Not Urgent & Not Important

# Technologies Used

Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js


# How to Use
Enter your tasks in the respective input fields.

Based on the urgency and importance, the tasks will be categorized into one of the four quadrants.

You can delete tasks once completed by clicking the delete icon next to each task.
